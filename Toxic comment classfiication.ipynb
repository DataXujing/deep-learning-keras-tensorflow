The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses \"\"BĀNG-E-DARĀ\"\" on the title page and \"\"Bāng-i-Darā\"\" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?\\n\\nSecondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what\\'s the best ratio?:\\n\\n\"\"An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:\\n\\n\"\"Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century\"\"\\n\\nI\\'ve replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I\\'ve rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) \\n\\nHi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:\\n E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired \"\"articles\"\"!\\n The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice\\n In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any \"\"source\"\" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation \\nIn your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.\\nThe use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of \"\"e\"\" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.\\nMany thanks indeed for your messsage.

This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided.

If so, then you are being contrary and absurd.  My burden, and those who support the move, was to provide reasons for the move, and it is then up to the opposition to cite reasons against it, which they have not done.

       " '\"\\nAre you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering\\'s attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man\\'s lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his \"\"mouth\"\", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user\\'s approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the \\'proper\\' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal\\'s standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal\\'s aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal\\'s overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He\\'s not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That\\'s not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It\\'s quite clear that he\\'s an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume?

       " '\", 16 December 2010 (UTC)\\nI\\'m sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing \"\"original research\"\" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means \"\"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process\"\".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing \"\"original research\"\".  All we can say is \"\"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.\"\"  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say \"\"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.\"\"  There is still room to debate how reliable \"\"published author Y\"\" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of \"\"Published author Y\"\".  The basic principle here is \"\"not published => not reliable\"\".  And self-published doesn\\'t count.    18:09\"',\n",

It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikki\\'s personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.

Specifically, why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of \"\"ebaY\"\" logo to go next to the current one, \"\"ebay,\"\" in the lead, is \"\"because I wanted it in there,\"\" even though that is a total lie; but it\\'s supposedly \"\"not okay\"\" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?\\n\\n3. Here\\'s another one: Why is it supposedly \"\"okay\"\" for him and \"\"smiley girl\"\" there to falsely accuse my edits of being \"\"vandalism\"\" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a \"\"personal attack\"\" just because I\\'m an IP-only editor?\\n\\n4.

Where have you been?!\\n\\nMaybe what you need to get you going is a little competition...\\n\\n Who are we competing with? \\n\\nEncyclopedia Britannica.  Specifically, with its Outline of knowledge (presented in its volume called the Propaedia).  Currently, they\\'re kicking our asses.  You\\'ve really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge (available only in the encyclopedia\\'s paper edition - not the online version).\\n\\nPortals. Informally, of course, just for the fun of it.  There are around 600 portals.  We\\'re about 100 behind them, with about 500 outlines.  Let\\'s blow past them and leave \\'em in the dust!\\n\\n Confusion in editors at large \\n\\nNow that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper (article space), recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia.\\n\\nHowever, I\\'ve noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages, and complain that they are redundant to articles.  Well, ya.  (That\\'s the point of an outline - to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding, for easy viewing and faster reading, and to provide a topical guide).  \\n\\nA few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals, not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines, nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization.\\n\\nThese problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before \"\"going public\"\", to prevent their expansion as the community\\'s awareness of these pages increases.  Consider the response we\\'d get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects, 500 article talk pages, and placed links in 500 see also sections, etc.\\n\\nThat could be a nightmare.\\n\\nSo...\\n\\n Encyclopedic and administrative support \\n\\nI\\'ve been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice.   They\\'re drafts, still under construction.  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them (directly or by providing feedback):\\n\\nFirst is an  article draft, intended to replace the current Outline article.\\n\\nNext is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages.\\n\\nLet me know what you think.

Go away, please.\\n\\nI know, you want me to hold the burden of proof.  Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.  See the German language page for more information in this regard.

Mary Baker Eddy was an emphatic and orthodox believer in the virgin birth. She certainly believed in the resurrection and the atonement (there is a chapter on \"\"Atonement and Eucharist\"\" in Science and Health). Heaven and hell are defined in the Glossary of the textbook, though they are understood differently in Christian Science than in mainstream Christianity. (It is true that CS does not adhere to the concept of miracles, seeing healing as a result of laws of nature that are not widely understood.) This section is so wrong that it really needs to be corrected in the interest of the accuracy of the article, whatever one might think of CS per se. I don\\'t have time to root out academic sources on this so I suggest that it simply be removed. The over-riding concern is, surely to give an accurate picture of the topic.

Regarding NRMs - if you\\'ll check the list, you\\'ll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You\\'re right that GCC doesn\\'t like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were \"\"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art.\"\" and \"\"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.\"\"\\n I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You\\'re right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is \"\"GCAC is an association of churches\"\".  That\\'s what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that\\'s what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let\\'s start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.\\n I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn\\'t find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we\\'re doing here - we\\'re putting facts up.  We don\\'t need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn\\'t found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don\\'t see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no \"\"typical view\"\" - if we\\'re going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don\\'t have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.   \"',\n",

This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]\\n\\n\"',\n",

I then stumbled upon one of his articles:\\n\\nIt was absolutly incredible.  Ward Churchill is an incredible historian. What do these attacks on Ward Churchill do?  They cause Americans to shy away from reading Churchill\\'s work, and they send a clear message to others who may want to attack American foreign policy: that you can lose your job if you criticize America, that you will be attacked viciously if you criticize America.  It is the latest form of American suppression of the Left.\\n\\nI am just interested if there is a list of authors, or a book or article about those who have been \"\"Swift Boated\"\" like Churchill.

       " '\"\\n\\nWith due respect this dog\\'s breakfast of an article deserves a POV rampage and a much more exhaustive one than the minor changes made on December 11. Please look over some of the undocumented, irrelevant, and in some cases just plain weird interpretations of Revelation that were removed or edited and suggest which edits should be undone. The article as a whole is unnecessarily repetitive and only a small fraction of it represents the views of modern scholarship (see my comments above under Talk section 11: Everyone\\'s view).\\n\\nOn Thomas Jefferson: Myth America I sympathise with your concern to \\'[provide] a useful contrast to the other interpretations in the article\\' which generally reflect conservative christian in-fighting about the meaning of the book but tell us very little about Revelation itself. I\\'m not convinced, however, that to dismiss the work as the incoherent ravings of an early christian \"\"heretic\"\" (Cerinthus) is the best way to do this. A number of scholars have demonstrated that the book follows a clearly marked concentric structure which evidences balanced literary construction, while it has long been acknowledged that Revelation parodies and inverts the imagery of first century roman imperialism and the emperor cult in particular to make it\\'s point (see eg Steven J Friesen\\'s recent work in this area: Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John). This hardly supports Jefferson\\'s view that the work is a meaningless rant but nor does it support the highly subjective perspectives of historicism and futurism which have obviously irritated you. A balanced, well documented historical-critical introduction to the work should, in my opinion, make up the bulk of this article with other conservative christian approaches acknowledged separately in brief, concise fashion. I am quite happy for the Jefferson reference to remain for its whimsical value and tentatively suggest that it could be accompanied by some of the numerous historical warnings by prominent christian leaders and commentators about the danger of misusing the book.\\n\\nI also note that the reference to Mithraic parallels has been re-inserted in the Authorship section. What this has to do with the question of authorship I have no idea. The parallel itself is completely unconvincing and the book from which it is taken is a typical example of an author falling in love with his subject and unnecessarily exaggerating its importance. While I don\\'t deny that the work, by Payam Nabarz, represents a good layman\\'s guide to Mithraism the suggested parallel between this quote and Revelation 1:4-20 on page 51 (see Google books for the text) hardly warrants the preface that the two are \\'almost identical\\' or the overly enthusiastic observation that \\'the [similarity of] spirit is abundant... to the extent that the names of Jesus and Mithras could be interchangeable\\'. These are not the remarks of a careful exegete. It is quite likely that there are echoes of Mithraism, the religion of the roman army, in Revelation, which freely reuses both Jewish and greco-roman mythology in polemical fashion, but this is not one of them. Would anyone object to a re-removal of this paragraph?\\n  \\n\\n\"\"this... article deserves a POV rampage\"\"— All I can say to that is read this WP:NPOV.\\nWhy not be inclusionist instead of deleting chunks of information you don\\'t personally agree with? An encylopedia is supposed to present all legitimate views, not stick with just one/the most popular.

Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn\\'t count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).  \\n\\nPerhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.\\n\\nIn fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD:\\nhttp://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.html\\n\\nNow, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here:\\nhttp://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf\\n\\nIn any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being \"\"wedded\"\" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.

       " \"First I want to mention that I deeply appreciate your candid, frank, and friendly response.  It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesn't see any need to bite someone's head off just because of a mistake, whatever the size.  Not that most Wikipedians do that, but cordiality is still nice.  Yes, I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other people's comments.  For me, the ill will is a much bigger factor, especially because I always try to be very careful to never change the meaning of a comment, but it is still a risk, as you say.\\n\\nYou're right, the edits are old and the link eventually gets you there.  These are trivial changes, but I find value in them.  It is true that the servers don't spend much time on redirects, but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to.  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I'll change my policy based on your well-made point: I'm only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.  Does that seem reasonable?\\n\\nI am interested in AWB, but I haven't really looked into it much.  Thanks for the tip.\\n\\nMy login problem is a toughie, as far as I can tell.  What happens is this: I click the register/login link at the top right of the page.  I enter my username and password.  It says I have successfully logged in, and even shows my username, etc., in the upper right.  But then, as soon as I switch to another page, I am logged out again.  I have checked my cookies, and I am accepting cookies from all Wikimedia projects that I'm working on.  It is possible it is a firewall problem, but I have no idea how to fix that.  And it isn't just at the school where I work: I can't login on computers in cybercafes in the area either.  Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something, but I never had this problem until around December 2006, which was about the time our school changed its ISP.  I don't know if that is related, but if that is the case, it seems strange that I can't even login when I'm off-campus.  A bit of a puzzler, isn't it?\\n\\nBTW, if you don't mind me saying so, I noticed that your contribs link in your signature doesn't go to your contributions page.

I can understand the concern, but let me tell you my experience about reading this marvelous article.  Moni, you really are courageous for taking this article on.  I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone's story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.

Another editor (or perhaps it was the same) then suggested that it might be noteworthy if it involved some sort of legal analysis. The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how Clinton's comparison amounts to a legal analysis.

The biggest problem is the first section which had the  \"\"proposed benefits of basic income\"\" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality \"\"blog classifiable\"\" sources available.\\n\\nIn order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)\\n\\nHere is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   \\n\\nProposed Benefits\\n\\nnaturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:\\n Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don\\'t spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.\\n Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.\\n Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened\\n Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.\\n Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.\\n Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.\\n Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.\\n Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.\\n It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.\\n Natural finance\\'s definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.\\n\\n\"',\n",

In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.\\n\\nThe sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524\\nThis occurs is 21/22 cases so:\\n\\n(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)\\n\\nTherefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap.

February fest days: http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this should be added in his biography.   \\nWP:SYNTH   \\nClose, but there\\'s no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)\\nPlease READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   \\nI get that. But what\\'s the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?

Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope\\'s role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I\\'m French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J.

Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it?\\n\\nBesides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

       " '\"\\n\\nI said clearly \"\"from their understanding, rightly or wrongly, from verses in the Bible, they arive at the date and believe to be the historical\"\" date.   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by \"\"believed-to-be historical\"\", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That\\'s not what I meant.    As far as the \"\"theological reasons\"\" the point too is why would they be so \"\"vested\"\" if they didn\\'t believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It\\'s all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was \"\"587\"\" instead of \"\"607\"\" (according to the whole \"\"2520 years\"\" view, which I know you don\\'t believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we\\'d still be living in the \"\"last days\"\" anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we\\'d still be in the \"\"end times\"\" if that\\'s the case.    But again, not to digress too much, I was simply answering your question, even though I thought that the discussion was already over.   You were not sure what I meant by \"\"believed-to-be historical date\"\" not just solely \"\"theological\"\".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole \"\"Gentile Times\"\" thing (as you know of course) for the whole \"\"Messiah\\'s Kingdom\"\" breaking in for the \"\"end times\"\" etc etc.    It\\'s whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they \"\"mis-translated\"\" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn\\'t, because seeing other translations they say \"\"I begin\"\" or \"\"I am beginning\"\" it does NOT say what you said of \"\"already beginning\"\".   There\\'s no real difference between the word \"\"beginning\"\" and \"\"start of\"\".    THAT\\'S THE POINT.     It says \"\"I am starting off\"\".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God \"\"already started off\"\".   So?    Because in all versions the word \"\"already\"\" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word \"\"beginning\"\" or \"\"start\"\".   Also, I\\'m a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are \"\"already beginning\"\" or \"\"first\"\" or \"\"starting off\"\".   Because if it\\'s \"\"already beginning\"\" as you said, wouldn\\'t that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say \"\"I am beginning with you\"\" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?  Also, again, how does your \"\"already beginning\"\" negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first?   Before other nations?     .........\"',\n",

He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a \"\"fact\"\" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.\\n\\nKarataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. \\n\\nThis is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  \\n\\nIn prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]\\n\\nHe did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don\\'t use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      \\n\\nHe escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]\\n\\nFollowing the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]\\n\\nfollowing police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.\\n\\nthis is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters.\"',\n",

       " '\"\\n\\n Anti-TKD slant \\n\\nI noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it\\'s a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under \"\"development of TKD\"\", controversies surrounding Karate\\'s influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It\\'s misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under \"\"traditional roots\"\" TKD\\'s foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under \"\"External Influence\"\" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. \\n\\nThe article is now overstating Taekwondo\\'s relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about \"\"Subak\"\" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon\\'s development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan\\'s influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let\\'s keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student\\'s guide.\\n\\nI think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let\\'s leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn\\'t very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800\\'s.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn\\'t mean that those arts weren\\'t passed down or that they didn\\'t exist.    While tkd isn\\'t taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD\\'s origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900\\'s.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn\\'t reflective objective reality behind TKD\\'s conception.\\n\\nbtw.  There\\'s a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800\\'s.   \\n\\nTo keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:\\n\\n1. We know that \"\"Subak\"\" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don\\'t really know exactly what \"\"Subak\"\" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced \"\"Shoubo\"\") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).\\n2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don\\'t actually know',\n",

We would like to take a more proactive approach to updating this information with current numbers, etc.  We are not sure who was responsible for originally writing the page, and we would like to make edits so that it reads less like a promotional piece/advertisement.\\n\\nWe would also like to put the following \"\"Controvery\"\" section up for discussion.  This section was recently posted on the page, and reads unobjectively.  Many of the claims are not reliablity sourced, and the extensiveness of the section was disproportionate relative to both the size of our page and similar sections on competitors\\' pages.  We have left three of our majo/significant events on the page, and are including the smaller/unsourced claims here for discussion.  We are open to discussing how best to frame this section so that it reads more objectively.\\n\\nControversy\\n\\nRaymond James has had been one of the most controversial firms with 49 regulatory events and 61 finalized arbitration\\'s including housing several ponzi schemes according to Finra.http://brokercheck.finra.org/Support/ReportViewer.aspx In spite of all the controversy that surrounds Raymond James, the firm has been vocal about trying to prevent any increase in regulation of the financial services industry.http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0813601120101108 \\nSome of the most notable controversies have included:\\n\\nIn 1997, Charles LeCroy, a Raymond James banker, helped issue bonds in Jefferson County through a noncompetitive process. These bonds ended up funding corrupt activities and led to the county\\'s bankruptcy.http://46in08.blogspot.com/2009/08/death-of-jefferson-county-alabama-and.html\\n\\nIn 2000, NASD regulators censured Raymond James & Associates, Inc. for “yield burning” activities on municipal securities. yield burning involves overcharges by brokerage firms on Treasury securities purchased with proceeds from the sale of municipal bonds. Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txt\\n\\nIn 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms. The minimal amount of due diligence conducted by the firm prevented them from discovering the fraud that was going on. The parent firm later went bankrupt causing millions in losses and one of the biggest fraud cases in the state of South Carolina.http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-02-05-homegold_x.htm\\n\\nIn 2003, Raymond James was found guilty of overcharging investors who made large purchases of mutual funds. There were nearly 160,000 trades that were overcharged and Raymond James had no systems in place to capture these trades.,http://www.txcm.com/reports/Raymond%20James%20mutual%20trading%20scandal.pdfhttp://registeredrep.com/institutions/raymondjames/finance_raymond_james_audits/\\n\\nIn 2005, the NASD fined Raymond James $750,000 for violations stemming from a failure to supervise the firm’s fee-based brokerage accounts.\\n\\nIn 2007, three ex-Raymond James employees sued, saying they were paid less than men and denied opportunities.http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/Women_claim_sex_bias_.shtml\\n\\nIn 2008, Jerry Rose was found to be conducting a ponzi scheme using Raymond James as custodian to the assets which amounted to over $16 million.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/story13.html\\n\\nIn 2008, Raymond James received lots of criticism for using obscure provisions under SOX in which they denied whistle-blowing claims on the basis that the claims were made against a subsidiary company.http://whistlersear.wordpress.com/tag/sox-whistleblower/ These laws were reversed when the new Frank Dowd act was put into place on July 21, 2010. Raymond James was mentioned as one of the companies that abused the laws, as a means to conduct ethical and legal grounds. This included the case of John Hughart v. Raymond James in which the complaints regarding lax supervision in compliance was overlooked on the grounds that the employee worked a a subsidiary and therefore had no opportunity for restitution from Raymond James.http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/SOX/2004/HUGHART_JOHN_v_RAYMOND_JAMES_and_AS_200',\n",

       " \"MUTUAL Intelligibility \\n\\nI've seen many people say that they can understand a different language on the discussion page and then list the languages as mutually intelligible. That is just one-sided intelligibility. Intelligibility differs from person to person and also depends on what is being said. For instance, if you're Russian you may understand a Polish guy completely, but your Russian friend may have no idea what's going on. And if the Polish guy says something else, you might not understand him at all. It is very hard to study intelligibility because there is so much variation. So just because you understand (or don't understand) something in a related language it does not mean that is the case for all speakers (or even most speakers) and it definitely does not guarantee it goes the other way around.\\nMutual intelligibility is not one guy being able to understand something in another language. This is an example of mutual intelligibility:\\n\\nA Polish guy is in the Czech Republic and asks a Czech guy for directions (in Polish). The Czech understands what he is saying and tells him where to go (in Czech). The Polish guy understands and finds where he needs to go.\\n\\nIf the Polish guy didn't understand then it is not mutual intelligibility. And this has to happen for a lot of people, not just those two guys. Alex\",\n",

You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the onus has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do. \\nNone of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. This does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e.g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( \\'Suna times\\' and \\'Waamo news\\'). \\nNo, there are not \"\"multiple images on Godane\"\", there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won\\'t make the other various portraits vanish. This still dose\\'t help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. This source here,  is the only thing that you have showed me which highlights that the image may not be Godane. I bet you\\'re smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have proven the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. This source is meager. It is unreliable as it is questionable. The article is a blog, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it\\'s riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e.g (\"\"Hammami is still advocating for Robow’s troopss.\"\") Are you kidding me? The author can\\'t even spell, and you\\'re taking this blog over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U.S State Department. Wow is all I can say. Furthermore, the blog doesn\\'t identity which picture is incorrect (If indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cites his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn\\'t help, as the author hasn\\'t established where he got his information from concerning this supposed \\'incorrect\\' image of Godane. Again, you\\'re going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point.\\nThe basis that \\'foreign media agencies\\' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material/information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. This geographical argument is meaningless. Ok then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well! ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not \\'based\\'? Hmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. What you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that\\'s Somalia or Timbuktu. This source for example from BBC  is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporters, correspondents, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source.
